                <p>
                    Mudjacking is a cost-effective alternative to replacing concrete. Mudjacking or concrete raising can usually be done for less than half the cost of pouring new concrete. Save time, money and the environment.

                    Most mudjacking projects can be completed quickly and economically with minimal disruption, and are ready for use the same day.

                    On the day of your work, 1-1/2″ holes are strategically drilled into the concrete slabs that require mudjacking.

                    A sand based mudjacking slurry is hydraulically pumped through the 1-1/2″ holes to fill voids and raise the settled concrete.

                    After the mudjacking is completed, a plug is inserted into the hole, and is patched with cement. While the concrete slab is ready for use immediately it is recommended that you allow the patch material to set up before use. This typically takes a couple of hours.

                    Most jobs can be done in one day, large jobs may take longer, and your operations can continue while we work. Typically EcoLift can work around your landscaping or machinery, working with your schedule.
